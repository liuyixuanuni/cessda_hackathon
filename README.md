# Overview
This project includes two functions to visualize educational mobility.
The first function, plot_sankey, is adapted from https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/sankey and can be used for other pathway visualizations.
The second function, plot_map, can be used for visualizing (semi)metric variables across European countries.
